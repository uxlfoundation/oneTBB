# oneTBB 2022.3 Release Notes

## :rocket: Preview Features
- Introduced API for setting dynamic task dependencies in task_group. This allows successor tasks to execute only after all their predecessors have completed.


## :tada: New Features
- Extended task_arena with API support for enqueuing functions into a task_group and waiting for the task_group to complete.
- Introduced API for setting and getting the assertion handler. This allows applications to set their own assertion handling functions.


## :rotating_light: Known Limitations
- The ``oneapi::tbb::info`` namespace interfaces might unexpectedly change the process affinity mask on Windows* OS systems (see https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc/issues/366 for details) when using hwloc version lower than 2.5.
- Using a hwloc version other than 1.11, 2.0, or 2.5 may cause an undefined behavior on Windows OS. See https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc/issues/477 for details.
- The NUMA topology may be detected incorrectly on Windows* OS machines where the number of NUMA node threads exceeds the size of 1 processor group.
- On Windows OS on ARM64*, when compiling an application using oneTBB with the Microsoft* Compiler, the compiler issues a warning C4324 that a structure was padded due to the alignment specifier. Consider suppressing the warning by specifying /wd4324 to the compiler command line.
- C++ exception handling mechanism on Windows* OS on ARM64* might corrupt memory if an exception is thrown from any oneTBB parallel algorithm (see Windows* OS on ARM64* compiler issue: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/ARM64-incorrect-stack-unwinding-for-alig/1544293.
- When CPU resource coordination is enabled, tasks from a lower-priority ``task_arena`` might be executed before tasks from a higher-priority ``task_arena``.
- When CPU resource coordination is enabled, cgroups CPU quota and period limitations settings are ignored.
- Using oneTBB on WASM* may cause applications to run in a single thread. See [Limitations of WASM Support](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/blob/master/WASM_Support.md#limitations).

> **_NOTE:_**  To see known limitations that impact all versions of oneTBB, refer to [oneTBB Documentation](https://uxlfoundation.github.io/oneTBB/main/intro/limitations.html).


## :hammer: Issues Fixed
- Fixed overwrite_node and write_once_node to prevent premature trigger of continue_node successors.
- Fixed keys duplication in concurrent_hash_map when the container is initialized using a pair of iterators, or std::initializer_list ([#1764](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/issues/1764)).
- Improved support for profiling tools by allowing the oneTBB notifications to be ignored by tools and by better timing of task completion notifications.
- Fixed incorrect deallocation of tasks in task_group ([#1834](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/issues/1834)).
- Improved performance scalability of spin_mutex::lock, spin_mutex::try_lock and queuing_mutex::scoped_lock::try_acquire.
- Fixed potential oversubscription issue by respecting CPU quota and period limitations provided via cgroups settings on Linux* ([#190](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/issues/190), [#1760](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/issues/1760)).

## :rotating_light: Known Limitations
- A static assert will cause compilation failures in oneTBB headers when compiling with clang 12.0.0 or newer if using the LLVM standard library with ``-ffreestanding`` and C++11/14 compiler options. 
- An application using Parallel STL algorithms in libstdc++ versions 9 and 10 may fail to compile due to incompatible interface changes between earlier versions of Threading Building Blocks (TBB) and oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB). Disable support for Parallel STL algorithms by defining ``PSTL_USE_PARALLEL_POLICIES`` (in libstdc++ 9) or ``_GLIBCXX_USE_TBB_PAR_BACKEND`` (in libstdc++ 10) macro to zero before inclusion of the first standard header file in each translation unit.
- On Linux* OS, if oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) or Threading Building Blocks (TBB) are installed in a system folder like ``/usr/lib64``, the application may fail to link due to the order in which the linker searches for libraries. Use the ``-L`` linker option to specify the correct location of oneTBB library. This issue does not affect the program execution.
- The ``oneapi::tbb::info`` namespace interfaces might unexpectedly change the process affinity mask on Windows* OS systems (see https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc/issues/366 for details) when using hwloc* version lower than 2.5.

- oneTBB does not support ``fork()``, to work-around the issue, consider using task_scheduler_handle to join oneTBB worker threads before using fork().
- C++ exception handling mechanism on Windows* OS on ARM64* might corrupt memory if an exception is thrown from any oneTBB parallel algorithm (see Windows* OS on ARM64* compiler issue: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/ARM64-incorrect-stack-unwinding-for-alig/1544293).

## :hammer: Issues Fixed
- Fixed the hang in the reserve method of concurrent unordered containers ([GitHub* #1056](http://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/issues/1056)).

- The NUMA topology may be detected incorrectly on Windows OS machines where the number of NUMA node threads exceeds the size of 1 processor group.
- On Windows OS on ARM64*, when compiling an application using oneTBB with the Microsoft* Compiler, the compiler issues a warning C4324 that a structure was padded due to the alignment specifier. Consider suppressing the warning by specifying /wd4324 to the compiler command line.
- oneTBB does not support fork(), to work-around the issue, consider using task_scheduler_handle to join oneTBB worker threads before using fork().
- C++ exception handling mechanism on Windows* OS on ARM64* might corrupt memory if an exception is thrown from any oneTBB parallel algorithm (see Windows* OS on ARM64* compiler issue: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/ARM64-incorrect-stack-unwinding-for-alig/1544293).

## :hammer: Issues Fixed
- Fixed oneapi::tbb::concurrent_bounded_queue::pop return type (GitHub* [#807](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/issues/807)).

# oneTBB 2021.7 Release Notes

## :rotating_light: Known Limitations
- A static assert causes compilation failures in oneTBB headers when compiling with Clang* 12.0.0 or newer if using the LLVM* standard library with -ffreestanding and C++11/14 compiler options.
- An application using Parallel STL algorithms in libstdc++ versions 9 and 10 may fail to compile due to incompatible interface changes between earlier versions of Threading Building Blocks (TBB) and oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB). Disable support for Parallel STL algorithms by defining PSTL_USE_PARALLEL_POLICIES (in libstdc++ 9) or _GLIBCXX_USE_TBB_PAR_BACKEND (in libstdc++ 10) macro to zero before inclusion of the first standard header file in each translation unit.
- On Linux* OS, if oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) or Threading Building Blocks (TBB) are installed in a system folder like /usr/lib64, the application may fail to link due to the order in which the linker searches for libraries. Use the -L linker option to specify the correct location of oneTBB library. This issue does not affect the program execution.
- The oneapi::tbb::info namespace interfaces might unexpectedly change the process affinity mask on Windows* OS systems (see https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc/issues/366 for details) when using hwloc version lower than 2.5.

## :hammer: Issues Fixed
- Memory allocator crash when allocating ~1TB on 64-bit systems (GitHub* [#838](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/issues/838)).
- Fixed thread distribution over NUMA nodes on Windows* OS systems.
- For oneapi::tbb::suspend, it is guaranteed that the user-specified callable object is executed by the calling thread.

## :rotating_light: Known Limitations

## :hammer: Issues Fixed
- Memory allocator crash on a system with an incomplete /proc/meminfo (GitHub* [#584](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/issues/584)).
- Incorrect blocking of task stealing (GitHub* #[478](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/issues/478)).
- Hang due to incorrect decrement of a limiter_node (GitHub* [#634](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/issues/634)).
- Memory corruption in some rare cases when passing big messages in a flow graph (GitHub* [#639](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/issues/639)).
- Possible deadlock in a throwable flow graph node with a lightweight policy. The lightweight policy is now ignored for functors that can throw exceptions (GitHub* [#420](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/issues/420)).
- Crash when obtaining a range from empty ordered and unordered containers (GitHub* [#641](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/issues/641)).
- Deadlock in a concurrent_vector resize() that could happen when the new size is less than the previous size (GitHub* [#733](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/issues/733)).
