# Dining philosophers node

Various flow-graph nodes accept a constructor argument that specifies the maximum concurrency the graph can assume for that particular node.
For example, in high-energy physics, an algorithm might reconstruct physics tracks from tracks recorded by an experiment's detector.
If the algorithm is not threadsafe, a reasonable node construction could be:

``` c++
using namespace tbb;
flow::graph g;
flow::function_node<Hits, Tracks> track_maker{
  g,
  flow::serial, 
  [](Hits const&) -> Tracks { ... }
};
```

where the `flow::serial` argument constrains the flow graph to execute the node body by no more than one thread at a time.

There are cases, however, where specifying a concurrency limit of `flow::serial` is insufficient to guarantee thread-safety of the full graph.
For example, suppose `track_maker` needs exclusive access to some database connection, and another node `cluster_maker` also needs access to the same database:

``` c++
flow::function_node<Hits, Tracks> track_maker{
  g,
  flow::serial,
  [](Hits const&) -> Tracks { auto a = db_unsafe_access(); ... }
};
flow::function_node<Signals, Clusters> cluster_maker{
  g,
  flow::serial, 
  [](Signals const&) -> Clusters { auto a = db_unsafe_access(); ... }
};
```

In the above, the function `db_unsafe_access()` returns a handle, providing thread-unsafe access to the database.
To avoid data races, the function bodies of `track_maker` and `cluster_maker` must not execute at the same time.
Achieving with flow graph such serialization between function bodies is nontrivial.
Options include:

1. placing an explicit lock around the use of the database, resulting in inefficiencies in the execution of the graph,
2. creating explicit edges between `track_maker` and `cluster_maker` even though there is not obvious data dependency between them,
3. creating a token-based system that can limit access to a shared resource.

We have implemented option 3 and describe it below in the "Implementation experience" section.
Our proposal, however, does not mandate any implementation but suggests an API similar to:

``` c++
auto& db_resource = flow::limited_resource(g, 1); // Only 1 database "token" allowed in the entire graph 

flow::function_node<Hits, Tracks> track_maker{
  g,
  db_resource,
  [](Hits const&) -> Tracks { auto a = db_unsafe_access(); ... }
};
flow::function_node<Signals, Clusters> cluster_maker{
  g,
  db_resource, 
  [](Signals const&) -> Clusters { auto a = db_unsafe_access(); ... }
};
```

where `db_resource` represents a limited resource to which both `track_maker` and `cluster_maker` require sole access.

## Proposal

> [!NOTE]
> Although we focus on the `flow::function_node` class template in this proposal, the concepts discussed here apply to nearly any flow-graph node that accepts a user-provided function body.

Our proposal consists of: 
1. Introducing the equivalent of a `flow::limited_resource` class template that, when connected with another node, ensures limited access to the resource it represents.
2. Adding `flow::function_node` constructors that allow the specification of limited resource nodes instead of a `concurrency` value.

``` c++
auto& gpu_resource = flow::limited_resource<GPU>(g, 2);
auto& root_resource = flow::limited_resource<ROOT>(g, 1);

flow::function_node<
  Hits,
  Tracks,
  tuple<GPU, ROOT>> fn{g,
                       make_tuple(gpu_resource, root_resource),
                       [](Hits const&, tuple<GPU, ROOT>) -> Tracks { ... }
                      };

```
### `flow::limited_resource` class template

The `flow::limited_resource` class template heuristically looks like:

```c++
template <typename Resource = /* implementation-defined */>
class limited_resource {
public:
  template <typename... Ts>
  limited_resource(flow::graph&, Ts... args_to_Resource_ctor);
};
```

where `Resource` represents a policy class.

#### Default `Resource` policy

For serialized nodes that do not need to access details of the resource, a default policy can be provided:

```c++
flow::limited_resource f{g, 2}; // Is there a use case for needing more than one token but not having access to the internals?
```

#### User-defined `Resource` policies

### Resource handles

Different token types that can carry state.

## Future work

> A proposal should clearly outline the alternatives that were considered,
> along with their pros and cons. Each alternative should be clearly separated
> to make discussions easier to follow.
>
> Pay close attention to the following aspects of the library:
> - API and ABI backward compatibility. The library follows semantic versioning
>   so if any of those interfaces are to be broken, the RFC needs to state that
>   explicitly.
> - Performance implications, as performance is one of the main goals of the library.
> - Changes to the build system. While the library's primary building system is
>   CMake, there are some frameworks that may build the library directly from the sources.
> - Dependencies and support matrix: does the proposal bring any new
>   dependencies or affect the supported configurations?
>
> Some other common subsections here are:
> - Discussion: some people like to list all the options first (as separate
>   subsections), and then have a dedicated section with the discussion.
> - List of the proposed API and examples of its usage.
> - Testing aspects.
> - Short explanation and links to the related sub-proposals, if any. Such
>   sub-proposals could be organized as separate standalone RFCs, but this is
>   not mandatory. If the change is insignificant or doesn't make any sense
>   without the original proposal, you can have it in the RFC.
> - Execution plan (next steps), if approved.
